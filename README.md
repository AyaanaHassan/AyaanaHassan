# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m Ayaan.

Over the course 16-weeks at The School of code, I coded my way to a new career in tech.
Recently I completed my final project, where I worked in an agile team to build an application implementing my knowledge and skills. 
School of code has enabled me to bloom into an industry ready software developer, with the ability write coding using best practise standards
and more importantly problem solve using TEAMWORK.
